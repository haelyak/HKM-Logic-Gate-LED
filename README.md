# HKM-Logic-Gate-LED
## This code will be compatible with a logic gate sensor board.

In order to run the code on an Adafruit ESP32-S3 TFT Feather, you will need to install CircuitPython, please see the Adafruit documentation: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-tft-feather/circuitpython

Once CircuitPython is actively installed on your Adafruit ESP32-S3 TFT Feather, you can open up code.py in your Mu Editor (or VS code if you follow these instructions to connect your serial console to your terminal: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/kattni-connecting-to-the-serial-console). You will save code.py to your device.

After plugging your Adafruit ESP32-S3 TFT Feather into your logic gate sensor board, the entire board should light up white to indicate setup. Then you should be ready to solve a logic gate puzzle!
